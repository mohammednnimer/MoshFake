# 🤖 AI Call & Scam Detection Application (Arena 2025)

Developed an AI-powered communication application that enables users to create accounts using their phone numbers and perform real-time voice calls similar to modern messaging platforms.

The system integrates an advanced AI detection engine (Arena 2025 Algorithm) to identify whether the caller is an AI-generated voice or a real human. If an AI-generated entity is detected during the call, the system instantly notifies the user.

Additionally, the platform includes a real-time scam and fraud detection module powered by NLP algorithms. The system analyzes conversation patterns to detect suspicious behavior such as:

* Requests for bank account information
* Asking for personal identification numbers
* Attempts to collect sensitive personal data
* Social engineering patterns
* Spam-like messaging behavior

When scam behavior is detected, the user receives an immediate warning notification.
